  American Express cardholders will face a significant reduction in value when transferring points to Cathay Pacific Airways, as the credit card giant implements a **20% devaluation** of its transfer ratio effective **March 1, 2026**. The change reduces transfers from the current **1:1 ratio to 5:4**, meaning cardholders will need **5 Membership Rewards points** to receive **4 Asia Miles** instead of the previous direct conversion.
  
  This devaluation represents one of the most substantial changes to American Express's transfer partner program in recent years, joining a broader trend of credit card issuers reducing the value proposition of their premium travel benefits.
  
  ## Capital One Also Cuts Emirates Partnership Value
  
  The Amex-Cathay Pacific change isn't happening in isolation. Capital One is simultaneously implementing an even steeper devaluation to its Emirates Skywards transfer partnership, reducing the ratio from **1:1 to 1:0.75** effective **January 13, 2026** — a **25% reduction** in value.
  
  These parallel moves by two major credit card issuers suggest a coordinated effort across the industry to reduce costs associated with airline transfer partnerships, which have become increasingly expensive to maintain as travel demand has surged post-pandemic.
  
  ## Impact on Premium Redemptions
  
  The timing and scale of these changes are particularly significant given how both partnerships have been utilized by savvy travelers. Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles program has long been considered one of the most valuable airline loyalty currencies, offering exceptional redemption rates for premium cabin travel across Asia and beyond.
  
  Similarly, Emirates Skywards miles have provided outsized value for first and business class redemptions on Emirates' extensive global network, particularly for routes to the Middle East, Asia, and Africa that are often prohibitively expensive when purchased with cash.
  
  According to industry analysis, these transfer partnerships have historically enabled redemptions worth **2-3 cents per point** or more for premium cabin bookings, far exceeding the typical **1-1.5 cents per point** value available through most other redemption options.
  
  ## Broader Industry Trends
  
  The simultaneous devaluations by American Express and Capital One reflect several underlying pressures facing the credit card industry in 2026. Airlines have become increasingly selective about their partnership terms as their own loyalty programs have grown more valuable and as travel demand has remained robust.
  
  Additionally, credit card issuers are facing pressure to maintain profitability amid rising operational costs and increased competition for premium cardholders. Transfer partnerships, while popular with consumers, represent a significant expense for card companies that must purchase miles and points from airline partners at wholesale rates.
  
  The changes also come as both American Express and Capital One have been expanding other aspects of their rewards programs, including new welcome bonuses and enhanced category multipliers, suggesting a strategic shift toward benefits that provide more predictable costs for the issuers.
  
  ## Timeline for Changes
  
  The **March 1, 2026** effective date for the Amex-Cathay Pacific change provides cardholders with a brief window to maximize transfers under the current favorable ratio. However, this timeline is relatively short compared to historical precedent, where major program changes typically included longer advance notice periods.
  
  Capital One's Emirates devaluation has already taken effect as of **January 13, 2026**, meaning those cardholders have already lost access to the more favorable transfer terms.
  
  ## Alternative Transfer Options
  
  While these specific partnerships are being devalued, both American Express and Capital One maintain extensive rosters of other airline and hotel transfer partners. American Express Membership Rewards points can still be transferred to partners including Delta Air Lines, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, and Hilton Honors, among others.
  
  Capital One's transfer partner network includes United Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Air Canada Aeroplan, and various hotel programs, providing alternative redemption paths for cardholders seeking travel value.
  
  However, the loss of favorable ratios to Cathay Pacific and Emirates specifically impacts travelers focused on Asia-Pacific routes and Middle Eastern carriers, where fewer high-value alternatives may be available.
  
  ## What This Means for Cardholders
  
  Cardholders with existing American Express Membership Rewards point balances should consider whether they have upcoming travel plans that could benefit from Cathay Pacific Asia Miles redemptions before the **March 1** deadline. The current **1:1 transfer ratio** effectively provides a **25% bonus** compared to the new terms.
  
  For those holding Capital One miles, the Emirates devaluation has already taken effect, meaning any future transfers will occur at the reduced **1:0.75 ratio**. Cardholders should evaluate whether alternative partners might provide better value for their specific travel goals.
  
  The changes also underscore the importance of diversifying point and mile accumulation strategies rather than focusing exclusively on a single transfer partner or redemption method. As partnerships continue to evolve, flexibility becomes increasingly valuable.
  
  Finally, these devaluations may influence credit card selection decisions for travelers who prioritized these specific transfer partnerships when choosing their primary rewards cards. The reduced value may prompt some cardholders to reassess whether their current cards still align with their travel and redemption preferences.
  
  Both American Express and Capital One continue to offer competitive rewards programs overall, but the landscape for maximizing premium travel redemptions through transfer partners has become more challenging with these latest changes.
