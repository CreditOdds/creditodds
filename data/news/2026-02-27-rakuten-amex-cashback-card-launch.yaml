  Rakuten and American Express have unveiled their latest collaboration, a co-branded credit card that promises to deliver some of the most competitive cash back rewards in the market. The new partnership combines Rakuten's extensive merchant network with American Express's premium card benefits, offering cardholders the opportunity to earn **up to 10% cash back** on eligible purchases.
  
  ## Card Features and Rewards Structure
  
  The new Rakuten American Express card leverages the strengths of both companies to create a unique rewards proposition. Cardholders will have access to Rakuten's vast network of online merchants, where they can earn enhanced cash back rates that can reach the advertised **10% maximum** on select purchases.
  
  While specific details about the card's tiered rewards structure have not been fully disclosed, the partnership is designed to maximize earning potential through Rakuten's existing merchant relationships. This approach differs from traditional credit card rewards programs by tapping into the cashback platform's established network of retail partners.
  
  The timing of this launch aligns with broader trends in the credit card industry for 2026, where financial institutions are increasingly focusing on competitive rewards structures to attract new customers amid a changing landscape of fees and benefits.
  
  ## Partnership Benefits
  
  The collaboration brings together American Express's reputation for premium customer service and exclusive benefits with Rakuten's proven track record in the cashback rewards space. Cardholders can expect to receive traditional American Express perks alongside enhanced earning opportunities through Rakuten's merchant network.
  
  This partnership represents a strategic move for both companies as they seek to differentiate their offerings in an increasingly competitive credit card market. For American Express, the collaboration provides access to Rakuten's extensive online shopping platform and merchant relationships. For Rakuten, partnering with a premium card issuer like American Express adds credibility and access to a more affluent customer base.
  
  ## Market Context and Industry Trends
  
  The launch comes at a time when the credit card industry is experiencing significant changes. According to recent industry analysis, **average credit card interest rates** currently range from **5.75% to 36%** for new applicants, with the average rate among credit card offers sitting at **22.07%** as of February 2026.
  
  The competitive landscape for rewards credit cards continues to intensify, with various issuers making adjustments to their benefit structures. Some major card programs have recently implemented changes to lounge access policies and other premium benefits, creating opportunities for new entrants to capture market share with compelling value propositions.
  
  ## Application and Eligibility
  
  While specific eligibility requirements for the new Rakuten American Express card have not been detailed, applicants can typically expect American Express's standard underwriting criteria. This generally includes requirements for good to excellent credit scores and sufficient income to support the credit line.
  
  The card application process will likely incorporate both American Express's established procedures and integration with Rakuten's existing customer platform, potentially offering streamlined approval for current Rakuten users.
  
  ## How the Rewards System Works
  
  The card's rewards structure is built around maximizing cash back through strategic partnerships with merchants in Rakuten's network. Cardholders will be able to earn enhanced rates when shopping through Rakuten's platform, with the potential to reach the advertised **10% cash back** rate on select purchases from participating merchants.
  
  This system differs from traditional flat-rate or category-based credit card rewards by leveraging existing merchant partnerships to provide variable, often higher, earning rates. The actual cash back percentage will depend on the specific merchant and any promotional offers available at the time of purchase.
  
  ## Integration with Existing Services
  
  The new credit card is designed to integrate seamlessly with Rakuten's existing cashback platform, allowing cardholders to combine credit card rewards with Rakuten's traditional online shopping rewards. This dual-earning potential could significantly increase the total rewards earned on eligible purchases.
  
  American Express cardholders will also retain access to the issuer's existing benefits ecosystem, including customer service, fraud protection, and any applicable premium services associated with their card tier.
  
  ## What This Means for Cardholders
  
  For consumers seeking maximum cash back potential, this new partnership offers a compelling option that could deliver higher returns than traditional rewards credit cards. The **up to 10% cash back** rate, while likely limited to specific merchants and purchases, represents one of the highest potential earning rates available in the current market.
  
  Existing Rakuten users may find particular value in this card, as it could streamline their rewards earning and provide additional benefits through the American Express partnership. The integration between the two platforms should create a more cohesive rewards experience for users who frequently shop through Rakuten's merchant network.
  
  However, cardholders should carefully review the terms and conditions to understand when and where the highest cash back rates apply. The "up to 10%" language suggests that maximum rates will be available only on select purchases or with specific merchants, making it important to understand the full rewards structure before applying.
  
  The card also represents an opportunity for consumers to access American Express's premium customer service and benefits while earning competitive cash back rates, potentially offering better value than choosing between cashback-focused cards and premium service providers separately.
