  If you're interested in credit card rewards, you've probably heard of the Chase 5/24 rule. It's one of the most important concepts to understand before applying for Chase cards, and it can significantly impact your approval odds.

  ## What is the 5/24 Rule?

  The Chase 5/24 rule is an unofficial policy that Chase uses when evaluating credit card applications. Here's the simple version:

  **If you've opened 5 or more personal credit cards (from any bank) in the past 24 months, Chase will automatically deny your application for most Chase cards.**

  This applies regardless of your credit score, income, or relationship with Chase.

  ## What Counts Toward 5/24?

  Understanding what counts is crucial for planning your applications:

  ### Does Count:
  - Personal credit cards from any issuer
  - Store cards (Target, Amazon, etc.)
  - Being added as an authorized user on someone else's card
  - Some business cards that report to personal credit bureaus

  ### Does NOT Count:
  - Most business credit cards (Chase Ink, Amex Business, etc.)
  - Corporate cards
  - Charge cards (in most cases)
  - Credit limit increases on existing cards
  - Product changes between cards

  ## Which Chase Cards Are Affected?

  Most Chase personal cards are subject to 5/24:

  - Chase Sapphire Preferred
  - Chase Sapphire Reserve
  - Chase Freedom Flex
  - Chase Freedom Unlimited
  - Chase Freedom Rise
  - United Explorer and Club cards
  - Southwest cards
  - Marriott Bonvoy cards
  - IHG cards
  - British Airways card
  - Aer Lingus card

  ### Cards NOT Subject to 5/24

  A few Chase cards have been known to bypass the rule:

  - Amazon Prime Visa
  - Disney Visa cards
  - Some co-branded hotel cards (varies)

  However, these exceptions can change, so always verify current data points before applying.

  ## How to Check Your 5/24 Status

  1. **Pull your credit report** from annualcreditreport.com
  2. **Count accounts opened** in the last 24 months
  3. **Include authorized user accounts** in your count
  4. **Exclude business cards** that don't appear on personal reports

  Many people use a simple spreadsheet to track their "5/24 count" over time.

  ## Strategies for Working With 5/24

  ### Strategy 1: Prioritize Chase Cards First

  If you're new to credit card rewards, apply for Chase cards before other issuers. Once you're over 5/24, you can still get cards from Amex, Capital One, Citi, and others.

  **Recommended Chase order:**
  1. Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve (best sign-up bonuses)
  2. Chase Freedom Flex (5% rotating categories)
  3. Chase Freedom Unlimited (1.5% on everything)
  4. Co-branded cards based on your travel preferences

  ### Strategy 2: Space Out Applications

  If you're at 4/24, you might want to wait before opening any new cards. Chase cards often have the best sign-up bonuses, so preserving a slot can be valuable.

  ### Strategy 3: Remove Authorized User Accounts

  If authorized user accounts are pushing you over 5/24, you can:
  1. Ask the primary cardholder to remove you
  2. Contact Chase directly during reconsideration and explain you're an AU, not the primary holder

  Chase may be willing to overlook AU accounts in some cases.

  ### Strategy 4: Wait It Out

  Cards fall off your 5/24 count exactly 24 months after the account open date. If you're at 6/24 but a card will age out in 2 months, it might be worth waiting.

  ## The Modified Double Dip (MDD)

  Advanced users sometimes use a technique called the Modified Double Dip to get two Chase cards in rapid succession. This involves:

  1. Applying for Card A
  2. Getting approved
  3. Applying for Card B the very next day (before the first card reports)

  **Warning:** This is an aggressive strategy that Chase may not appreciate. Use at your own risk, and never apply for more cards than you can responsibly manage.

  ## Common 5/24 Myths

  **Myth:** "Having a Chase bank account helps bypass 5/24"
  **Reality:** Your banking relationship does not override 5/24.

  **Myth:** "High income or excellent credit can override 5/24"
  **Reality:** 5/24 is a hard rule applied before other factors.

  **Myth:** "Calling reconsideration will get you approved"
  **Reality:** 5/24 denials cannot typically be overturned through recon.

  ## Planning Your Card Strategy

  Here's a sample timeline for someone starting fresh:

  - **Month 0:** Chase Sapphire Preferred (1/24)
  - **Month 3:** Chase Freedom Flex (2/24)
  - **Month 6:** Chase Freedom Unlimited (3/24)
  - **Month 9:** Chase co-branded card of choice (4/24)
  - **Month 12:** One more Chase card or start branching out (5/24)
  - **Month 15+:** Amex, Citi, Capital One cards

  ## The Bottom Line

  The 5/24 rule is frustrating, but understanding it puts you ahead of most applicants. Plan your applications strategically, prioritize Chase cards early, and you'll maximize your chances of building a powerful rewards portfolio.

  Remember: slow and steady wins the rewards game. Don't rush into applications just to hit a number — make sure each card genuinely fits your spending and travel goals.
